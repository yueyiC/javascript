In this scenario, there is an array called items containing objects with properties like color, type, and age. Additionally, there is an array named excludes consisting of key-value pairs. There exists a function called excludeItems which aims to remove items from items that contain properties specified in the excludes array. 

Currently, the implementation of this function involves iterating through the excludes array using forEach, and then filtering out items one by one using the filter function. However, the intention is to exclude items, but the current implementation includes them.

To rectify this, we should use an exclamatory mark to evaluate the condition as false. The time complexity of the current function is O(n*m). To optimize this function, we first preprocess the excludes array by creating an excludeMap object. We iterate through the key-value pairs in the excludes array, checking if excludeMap doesn't contain the property k. If not, we add a new property k to the excludeMap as a Set object and add the current property value to it. Then, when the items array calls the filter function, we extract all property values of the current item using Object.keys and then iterate through them using the every function. We check if the excludeMap doesn't contain these properties or if the values corresponding to these properties are not in the excludeMap,  return true.
